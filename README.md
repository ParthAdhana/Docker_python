# Project Title

## Overview

This repository is my playground for learning Docker and Python. In this project, I am experimenting with Docker by containerizing a simple Python server application.

## Project Description

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers provide an isolated environment where you can package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations. Docker allows me to run my Python application in a consistent and reproducible environment across different machines.

### Python

Python is a powerful, versatile, and easy-to-read programming language. In this project, I have created a simple Python server that listens on port 3000 and responds to incoming GET requests. The server responds with a "hello" message when accessed at the `/hello` endpoint.

## Additional Notes
Feel free to explore and modify the Python server code (server.py) to experiment with different responses or endpoints.
You can also try adding more functionality and see how Docker helps in managing the dependencies and running your Python application consistently across different environments.
